I am an **Associate Data Engineer** with hands-on experience building and optimizing ETL pipelines, managing multi-source data ingestion, and working with cloud-based data warehouses including **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, and **AWS Redshift**.

Skilled in **Python**, **SQL**, **dbt**, and modern data engineering tools such as **Apache Airflow**, **Spark**, and **AWS Glue**, I have expertise in data modeling, pipeline orchestration, and ensuring data quality, reliability, and scalability. I am experienced in transforming raw data into high-quality, analytics-ready datasets, developing data-driven solutions, and contributing to large-scale projects with hundreds of tables and multi-channel pipelines.

## 💻 Projects

### [Simple Cloud-Based Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow on AWS EC2](https://github.com/asadali27232/) _(Dec 2025)_

This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using **Apache Airflow** deployed on an **AWS EC2** Ubuntu instance. The pipeline orchestrates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of NYC 311 Service Request data through a series of automated tasks. Raw JSON data is fetched from the NYC Open Data API, processed using **Pandas** for data cleaning and standardization, and ultimately stored in **Amazon S3** in Parquet format for optimized query performance.

### [Terraform-Powered AWS Glue ETL: Infrastructure as Code](https://github.com/asadali27232/) _(Dec 2025)_

ETL pipeline using **Terraform** to automate AWS infrastructure provisioning for **Glue**, **RDS**, **S3**, and **Athena**. The system extracts MySQL retail data, transforms it into a star schema via **PySpark** jobs, and loads Parquet-optimized files into S3 for serverless analytics, demonstrating Infrastructure as Code, dimensional modeling, and cost-efficient cloud data engineering.

### [YouTube's Data Engineering: ETL & Cloud Pipeline](https://github.com/asadali27232/) _(Dec 2025)_

This project demonstrates a data engineering pipeline implementation, including ingestion, ETL, and cloud-based storage using **AWS**. It processes structured and semi-structured data to create a clean dataset and builds an interactive **Power BI** dashboard for visualization. The system is scalable, automated, and cloud-based, showcasing real-world data engineering practices.

### [CardioGraph Pro - FYP](https://github.com/asadali27232/FYP) _(Feb 2024 – Jan 2025)_

Led the handling and analysis of 20,000 ECG signal files (time-series data) using Python, performing EDA with Pandas and Matplotlib, basic data cleaning, and designing a data pipeline to integrate with a machine learning model and web interface, ensuring efficient and accurate data processing.
